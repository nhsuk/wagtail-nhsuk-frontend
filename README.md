A wagtail implementation of the [NHS frontend v6.2.0](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend) standard components.

## Installation

Install the pypi package
```
pip install wagtail-nhsuk-frontend
```

Add to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in wagtail settings
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...

  'wagtailnhsukfrontend',

  ...
]
```

Use blocks in your streamfields
```python
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.fields import StreamField

from wagtailnhsukfrontend.blocks import ActionLinkBlock, WarningCalloutBlock

class HomePage(Page):
  body = StreamField([
      # Include any of the blocks you want to use.
      ('action_link', ActionLinkBlock()),
      ('callout', WarningCalloutBlock()),
  ], use_json_field=True)

  content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
      FieldPanel('body'),
  ]
```

Use templatetags
```django
{% load nhsukfrontend_tags %}

<html>
...
<body>
  {% breadcrumb %}
</body>
</html>
```

Use template includes
```django
{% include 'wagtailnhsukfrontend/header.html' with show_search=True %}
```

See the [component documentation](./docs/components/) for a list of components you can use.

Include the CSS in your base template
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'wagtailnhsukfrontend/css/nhsuk.min.css' %}">
```

Include the Javascript in your base template
```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'wagtailnhsukfrontend/js/nhsuk.min.js' %}" defer></script>
```
## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from v0 to v1, see the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

This CSS and JS is taken directly from the [nhsuk-frontend library](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.1.0) and provided in this package for convenience.

If you have a more complicated frontend build such as compiling your own custom styles, you might want to [install from npm](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md) instead.
