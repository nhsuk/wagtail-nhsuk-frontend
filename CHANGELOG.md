### Upgrade Considerations
- Deprecated blocks `PanelBlock`, `PanelList`, `GreyPanelBlock`, `PromoBlock`, `PromoGroupBlock` have been removed from the plugin.
- In order to replace these blocks with the recommended `CardBasicBlock`-type blocks, you should:
    - Upgrade to v0.8.0 or v0.7.0 where the deprecated blocks exist alongside the Card blocks.
    - Migrate `PanelBlock` and `GreyPanelBlock` to `CardFeatureBlock` as follows:
    ```
    label -> feature_heading
    heading_level -> heading_level
    body -> body
    ```
    - Migrate `PanelList` to `CardGroupBlock` by mapping `panels` to `body` with the `BodyStreamBlock` class and setting `columns` as `'one-half'`.
    - Migrate `PromoBlock` to `CardImageBlock` as follows:
    ```
    url -> url
    heading -> heading
    description -> body
    content_image -> content_image
    alt_text -> alt_text
    size -> heading_size
    heading_level -> heading_level
    ```
    - Migrate `PromoGroupBlock` to `CardGroupBlock` by mapping `promos` to `body` using the `BodyStreamBlock` class, `column` maps to `column`. `size` and `heading_level` map to their respective fields in the child Card blocks.
- After all deprecated blocks have been migrated, you can upgrade to v1.0.0 without any loss of data.
