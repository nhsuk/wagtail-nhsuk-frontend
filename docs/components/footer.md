# Footer

## Wagtail Site Settings

wagtail-nhs-style comes with a wagtail
[site settings](http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.4/reference/contrib/settings.html)
model. If you want to allow CMS users to configure the footer in the wagtail
interface, use of the site setting is recommended.

Add the `wagtailnhsukfrontend.settings` module to your `INSTALLED_APPS` config.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...
  'wagtailnhsukfrontend',
  'wagtailnhsukfrontend.settings',
  ...
]
```

This will create a new option under `Settings > Footer settings` in the
wagtail interface.

To include the footer in your template, use the `header` templatetag.

```python
{% load nhsukfrontendsettings_tags %}

...

<body>
  ...
  {% footer %}
</body>
```

## Column-based Footer

2. Tick **"Enable column-based footer"**
3. Add footer links using the **"Footer Column Links"** panel
4. For each link:
   - Select the column number (1â€“4)
   - Enter the link label
   - Choose either:

     - An external URL using **"Link URL"**
